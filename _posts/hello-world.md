"Hello, I'm Ika and I have 15+ years of professional experience."

It was only recently that this sentence was true for the first time, and it was the exact moment I decided to create my personal space. (well, only after the shock of realizing how fast time is moving forward)

I'm a Javascript Developer, Tech Lead, Architect, Co-Founder, and I occasionally enjoy creating UI designs and graphics.

Throughout my career I had a lot of interesting challenges, both technical and non-technical. For some of them I have found interesting solutions, for others I made mistakes and learned from them. 

These are the main topics I want to share through this page.

In addition to my work life, I enjoy photography, modern art, reading books, DJing with the vinyl and building the collection. I've met a lot of individuals with their amazing stories and strong personalities. Since this is my personal space and I'm free to do as I like, I'm also going to post about these topics too.

The simple way to follow updates is via my personal [twitter](https://twitter.com/itsikap).

Stay tuned,

Cheers ☀️
