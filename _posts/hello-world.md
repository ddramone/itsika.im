Hello, I'm Ika and I have 15+ years of professional experience. 

This phrase became true for the first time only recently. And it was the exact moment I decided to create my personal space.

I'm a co-founder of [Stack Browser](https://www.stackbrowser.com), Tech Lead, Architect, Javascript Developer, and I occasionally enjoy creating UI designs and graphics.

Throughout my career I had a lot of interesting challenges, both technical and non-technical. For some of them I believe I have found interesting solutions, for others I made mistakes and learned from them.

These are the main topics I want to share through this space.

In addition to my work life, I enjoy photography, modern art, reading books, I'm collecting music on vinyl and sometimes performing as a DJ. I've met a lot of individuals with extraordinary personalities and amazing stories. Since this is my personal space and I'm free to do as I like, I'm also going to post about these topics too.


The best way to follow me is via my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsikap)

Stay tuned.

Cheers ✌️
