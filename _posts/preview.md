I'm coming from that generation for whom the icon of the save button makes a lot of sense. 20 years ago most of the manufacturers were still providing floppy disk drives as the standard equipment. I'm not old, it's just technology that grows up super fast.


I remember I was around 12 figuring out how to use the Internet. I was sitting at the computer with the dial-up connection, and I got lucky to become 1 000 000th user of one of the websites. I got excited and clicked the box that was congratulating me winning good amount of money with few zeros in it. Obviously I called the number, and, blamed my lack of English to miss the lifetime opportunity until I realized that I was caught in the click-bait.

Fast forward 20 years, digital world became essential part of our lives. Our online presence has also changed. Most of our work happens online, we have Internet in our pockets, we can warm up our living 1 day prior the vacation ends, AI is helping scientists to understand brain, Dall-E creates some *weird* stuff people call Art, Bots are taking over Twi…

Anyway, this list can go forever, but my main point is that the digital life is changing rapidly without us realizing it. Furthermore, we're anticipating even bigger leaps. Friend of mine was *complaining* that yet another big black dot back of the iPhone is not enough.

WE WANT MORE!

HOLOGRAMS!

SELF-ENTERTAINING PETS!

But, for real, having things in motion with such a big speed is exciting, heartening, but at the same time it is scary, and it can not possibly happen without the consequences.

I’m cautious about my online activity. I use password managers with 2 way encryption; I never use the same password twice; I have 2FA activated everywhere possible; I carefully pick what cookies do I share (essentially only required ones); I use applications that prevent tracking.

I'm trying to protect myself from online pirates, hackers, scammers, companies who harvest data without my consent and sell  it or use it for various reasons.

There had been a lot of research done that analyzes the data harvesting through a lot of different pillars. There are articles, movies, books with contradictive opinions. What I want to share is my personal reflection, how do I *feel* about my Digital Life.

In the physical life, more or less I'm in power of guaranteeing my safety, at least some portion of it. At the end of the day when I go home and lie on my sofa I feel safe. And free.


Honestly, I think I should be putting more effort into my online safety. Nevertheless I still qualify to top XX percent of users who understands how the data harvesting works.



You’d be surprised how many people still believe that it's just a coincidence that the Facebook shows advertisements for sneakers you're actually looking for, or gift ideas for your friend who happens to have a birthday this week. One day you post a photo of your new-born child and next day you’re swamped by a lot of diaper options. Or post a great news about your new house, and it’s going to be decorated by the AI without you realizing it.



If all these sounds funny to you (and I hope it does), good luck explaining it to your parents.
